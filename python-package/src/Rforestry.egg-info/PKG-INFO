## Rforestry: Random Forests, Linear Trees, and Gradient Boosting for Inference and Interpretability

Sören Künzel, Theo Saarinen, Simon Walter, Sam Antonyan, Edward Liu, Allen Tang, Jasjeet Sekhon


## Introduction

Rforestry is a fast implementation of Honest Random Forests, Gradient Boosting,
and Linear Random Forests, with an emphasis on inference and interpretability.

## How to install - R Package
1. The GFortran compiler has to be up to date. GFortran Binaries can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries).
2. The [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) package has to be installed. You can install it using,  `install.packages("devtools")`.
3. The package contains compiled code, and you must have a development environment to install the development version. You can use `devtools::has_devel()` to check whether you do. If no development environment exists, Windows users download and install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and macOS users download and install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
4. The latest development version can then be installed using
`devtools::install_github("forestry-labs/Rforestry")`. For Windows users, you'll need to skip 64-bit compilation `devtools::install_github("forestry-labs/Rforestry", INSTALL_opts = c('--no-multiarch'))` due to an outstanding gcc issue.


## How to install - Python Package

The python package must be compiled before it can be used. 
Note that to compile and link the C++ version of forestry, one must be using either OSX or Linux and must have a C++ compiler installed.
For example, one can run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .
make

```

## Python Package Usage

Then the python code can be called:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from random import randrange
from forestry import forestry
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = load_iris()
df = pd.DataFrame(data['data'], columns=data['feature_names'])
df['target'] = data['target']
X = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'sepal length (cm)']
y = df['sepal length (cm)']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

fr = forestry(ntree = 500)

print("Fitting the forest")
fr.fit(X_train, y_train)


print("Predicting with the forest")
forest_preds = fr.predict(X_test)

```

### Plotting the forest

For visualizing the trees, make sure to install the [dtreeviz](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz#readme) python library.

```python
from dtreeviz.trees import *
from forestry_shadow import ShadowForestryTree


shadow_forestry = ShadowForestryTree(fr, X, y, X.columns.values, 'sepal length (cm)', tree_id=0)

viz = dtreeviz(shadow_forestry,
                scale=3.0,
                target_name='sepal length (cm)',
                feature_names=X.columns.values)

viz.view()

```


## R Package Usage




set.seed(292315)
test_idx <- sample(nrow(iris), 3)
x_train <- iris[-test_idx, -1]
y_train <- iris[-test_idx, 1]
x_test <- iris[test_idx, -1]

rf <- forestry(x = x_train, y = y_train, nthread = 2)

predict(rf, x_test)
```
