#' @title forestry
#' @rdname forestry
#' @param x A data frame of all training predictors.
#' @param y A vector of all training responses.
#' @param ntree The number of trees to grow in the forest. The default value is
#'   500.
#' @param replace An indicator of whether sampling of training data is with
#'   replacement. The default value is TRUE.
#' @param sampsize The size of total samples to draw for the training data. If
#'   sampling with replacement, the default value is the length of the training
#'   data. If sampling without replacement, the default value is two-thirds of
#'   the length of the training data.
#' @param sample.fraction If this is given, then sampsize is ignored and set to
#'   be round(length(y) * sample.fraction). It must be a real number between 0 and 1
#' @param mtry The number of variables randomly selected at each split point.
#'   The default value is set to be one-third of the total number of features of the training data.
#' @param nodesizeSpl Minimum observations contained in terminal nodes.
#'   The default value is 5.
#' @param nodesizeAvg Minimum size of terminal nodes for averaging dataset.
#'   The default value is 5.
#' @param nodesizeStrictSpl Minimum observations to follow strictly in terminal nodes.
#'   The default value is 1.
#' @param nodesizeStrictAvg The minimum size of terminal nodes for averaging data set to follow when predicting.
#'   No splits are allowed that result in nodes with observations less than this parameter.
#'   This parameter enforces overlap of the averaging data set with the splitting set when training.
#'   When using honesty, splits that leave less than nodesizeStrictAvg averaging
#'   observations in either child node will be rejected, ensuring every leaf node
#'   also has at least nodesizeStrictAvg averaging observations. The default value is 1.
#' @param minSplitGain Minimum loss reduction to split a node further in a tree.
#' @param maxDepth Maximum depth of a tree. The default value is 99.
#' @param interactionDepth All splits at or above interaction depth must be on
#'   variables that are not weighting variables (as provided by the interactionVariables argument).
#' @param interactionVariables Indices of weighting variables.
#' @param featureWeights (optional) vector of sampling probabilities/weights for each
#'   feature used when subsampling mtry features at each node above or at interactionDepth.
#'   The default is to use uniform probabilities.
#' @param deepFeatureWeights Used in place of featureWeights for splits below interactionDepth.
#' @param observationWeights Denotes the weights for each training observation
#'   that determine how likely the observation is to be selected in each bootstrap sample.
#'   This option is not allowed when sampling is done without replacement.
#' @param customSplitSample List of vectors for user-defined splitting observations per tree. The vector at
#'   index i contains the indices of the sampled splitting observations, with replacement allowed, for tree i.
#'   This feature overrides other sampling parameters and must be set in conjunction with customAvgSample.
#' @param customAvgSample List of vectors for user-defined averaging observations per tree. The vector at
#'   index i contains the indices of the sampled splitting observations, with replacement allowed, for tree i.
#'   This feature overrides other sampling parameters and must be set in conjunction with customSplitSample.
#' @param customExcludeSample An optional list of vectors for user-defined excluded observations per tree. The vector at
#'   index i contains the indices of the excluded observations for tree i. An observation is considered excluded if it does
#'   not appear in the splitting or averaging set and has been explicitly withheld from being sampled for a tree.
#'   Excluded observations are not considered out-of-bag, so when we call predict with aggregation = "oob",
#'   when we predict for an observation, we will only use the predictions of trees in which the
#'   observation was in the customSplitSample (and neither in the customAvgSample nor the customExcludeSample).
#'   This parameter is optional even when customSplitSample and customAvgSample are set.
#'   It is also optional at the tree level, so can have fewer than ntree entries. When given fewer than
#'   ntree entries, for example K, the entries will be applied to the first K trees in the forest and
#'   the remaining trees will have no excludedSamples.
#' @param splitratio Proportion of the training data used as the splitting dataset.
#'   It is a ratio between 0 and 1. If the ratio is 1 (the default), then the splitting
#'   set uses the entire data, as does the averaging set---i.e., the standard Breiman RF setup.
#'   If the ratio is 0, then the splitting data set is empty, and the entire dataset is used
#'   for the averaging set (This is not a good usage, however, since there will be no data available for splitting).
#' @param OOBhonest In this version of honesty, the out-of-bag observations for each tree
#'   are used as the honest (averaging) set. This setting also changes how predictions
#'   are constructed. When predicting for observations that are out-of-sample
#'   (using predict(..., aggregation = "average")), all the trees in the forest
#'   are used to construct predictions. When predicting for an observation that was in-sample (using
#'   predict(..., aggregation = "oob")), only the trees for which that observation
#'   was not in the averaging set are used to construct the prediction for that observation.
#'   aggregation="oob" (out-of-bag) ensures that the outcome value for an observation
#'   is never used to construct predictions for a given observation even when it is in sample.
#'   This property does not hold in standard honesty, which relies on an asymptotic
#'   subsampling argument. By default, when OOBhonest = TRUE, the out-of-bag observations
#'   for each tree are resamples with replacement to be used for the honest (averaging)
#'   set. This results in a third set of observations that are left out of both
#'   the splitting and averaging set, we call these the double out-of-bag (doubleOOB)
#'   observations. In order to get the predictions of only the trees in which each
#'   observation fell into this doubleOOB set, one can run predict(... , aggregation = "doubleOOB").
#'   In order to not do this second bootstrap sample, the doubleBootstrap flag can
#'   be set to FALSE.
#' @param doubleBootstrap The doubleBootstrap flag provides the option to resample
#'   with replacement from the out-of-bag observations set for each tree to construct
#'   the averaging set when using OOBhonest. If this is FALSE, the out-of-bag observations
#'   are used as the averaging set. By default this option is TRUE when running OOBhonest = TRUE.
#'   This option increases diversity across trees.
#' @param seed random seed
#' @param verbose Indicator to train the forest in verbose mode
#' @param nthread Number of threads to train and predict the forest. The default
#'   number is 0 which represents using all cores.
#' @param splitrule Only variance is implemented at this point and it
#'   specifies the loss function according to which the splits of random forest
#'   should be made.
#' @param middleSplit Indicator of whether the split value is takes the average of two feature
#'   values. If FALSE, it will take a point based on a uniform distribution
#'   between two feature values. (Default = FALSE)
#' @param doubleTree if the number of tree is doubled as averaging and splitting
#'   data can be exchanged to create decorrelated trees. (Default = FALSE)
#' @param naDirection Sets a deterministic direction at each split point for
#'   observations with a missing value for the splitting feature. It selects the
#'   direction that minimizes loss, comparing sending all missing values in the
#'   training data to the left or to the right. If there are no missing values
#'   in the training data at a given split, the direction is determined by a
#'   random draw based on the distribution of observations on the left and
#'   right. (Default = FALSE)
#' @param reuseforestry Pass in an `forestry` object which will recycle the
#'   dataframe the old object created. It will save some space working on the
#'   same data set.
#' @param maxObs The max number of observations to split on.
#' @param savable If TRUE, then RF is created in such a way that it can be
#'   saved and loaded using save(...) and load(...). However, setting it to TRUE
#'   (default) will take longer and use more memory. When
#'   training many RF, it makes sense to set this to FALSE to save time and memory.
#' @param saveable deprecated. Do not use.
#' @param linear Indicator that enables Ridge penalized splits and linear aggregation
#'   functions in the leaf nodes. This is recommended for data with linear outcomes.
#'   For implementation details, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06463. Default is FALSE.
#' @param linFeats A vector containing the indices of which features to split
#'   linearly on when using linear penalized splits (defaults to use all numerical features).
#' @param monotonicConstraints Specifies monotonic relationships between the continuous
#'   features and the outcome. Supplied as a vector of length p with entries in
#'   1,0,-1 which 1 indicating an increasing monotonic relationship, -1 indicating
#'   a decreasing monotonic relationship, and 0 indicating no constraint.
#'   Constraints supplied for categorical variable will be ignored.
#' @param groups A vector of factors specifying the group membership of each training observation.
#'   these groups are used in the aggregation when doing out of bag predictions in
#'   order to predict with only trees where the entire group was not used for aggregation.
#'   This allows the user to specify custom subgroups which will be used to create
#'   predictions which do not use any data from a common group to make predictions for
#'   any observation in the group. This can be used to create general custom
#'   resampling schemes, and provide predictions consistent with the Out-of-Group set.
#' @param minTreesPerFold The number of trees which we make sure have been created leaving
#'   out each fold (each fold is a set of randomly selected groups).
#'    This is 0 by default, so we will not give any special treatment to
#'   the groups when sampling observations, however if this is set to a positive integer, we
#'   modify the bootstrap sampling scheme to ensure that exactly that many trees
#'   have each group left out. We do this by, for each fold, creating minTreesPerFold
#'   trees which are built on observations sampled from the set of training observations
#'   which are not in a group in the current fold. The folds form a random partition of
#'   all of the possible groups, each of size foldSize. This means we create at
#'   least # folds * minTreesPerFold trees for the forest.
#'   If ntree > # folds * minTreesPerFold, we create
#'   max(# folds * minTreesPerFold, ntree) total trees, in which at least minTreesPerFold
#'   are created leaving out each fold.
#' @param foldSize The number of groups that are selected randomly for each fold to be
#'   left out when using minTreesPerFold. When minTreesPerFold is set and foldSize is
#'   set, all possible groups will be partitioned into folds, each containing foldSize unique groups
#'   (if foldSize doesn't evenly divide the number of groups, a single fold will be smaller,
#'   as it will contain the remaining groups). Then minTreesPerFold are grown with each
#'   entire fold of groups left out.
#' @param monotoneAvg This is a boolean flag that indicates whether or not monotonic
#'   constraints should be enforced on the averaging set in addition to the splitting set.
#'   This flag is meaningless unless both honesty and monotonic constraints are in use.
#'   The default is FALSE.
#' @param overfitPenalty Value to determine how much to penalize the magnitude
#'   of coefficients in ridge regression when using linear splits.
#' @param scale A parameter which indicates whether or not we want to scale and center
#'   the covariates and outcome before doing the regression. This can help with
#'   stability, so by default is TRUE.
#' @return A `forestry` object.

#' Treatment of Missing Data
#'
#' In version 0.9.0.34, we have modified the handling of missing data. Instead of
#' the greedy approach used in previous iterations, we now test any potential
#' split by putting all NA's to the right, and all NA's to the left, and taking
#' the choice which gives the best MSE for the split. Under this version of handling
#' the potential splits, we will still respect monotonic constraints. So if we put all
#' NA's to either side, and the resulting leaf nodes have means which violate
#' the monotone constraints, the split will be rejected.

# -- Predict Method ------------------------------------------------------------
#' predict-forestry
#' @name predict-forestry
#' @rdname predict-forestry
#' @description Return the prediction from the forest.
#' @param object A `forestry` object.
#' @param newdata A data frame of testing predictors.
#' @param aggregation How the individual tree predictions are aggregated:
#'   `average` returns the mean of all trees in the forest; `terminalNodes` also returns
#'   the weightMatrix, as well as "terminalNodes", a matrix where
#'   the ith entry of the jth column is the index of the leaf node to which the
#'   ith observation is assigned in the jth tree; and "sparse", a matrix
#'   where the ith entry in the jth column is 1 if the ith observation in
#'   newdata is assigned to the jth leaf and 0 otherwise. In each tree the
#'   leaves are indexed using a depth first ordering, and, in the "sparse"
#'   representation, the first leaf in the second tree has column index one more than
#'   the number of leaves in the first tree and so on. So, for example, if the
#'   first tree has 5 leaves, the sixth column of the "sparse" matrix corresponds
#'   to the first leaf in the second tree.
#'   `oob` returns the out-of-bag predictions for the forest. We assume
#'   that the ordering of the observations in newdata have not changed from
#'   training. If the ordering has changed, we will get the wrong OOB indices.
#'   `doubleOOB` is an experimental flag, which can only be used when OOBhonest = TRUE
#'   and doubleBootstrap = TRUE. When both of these settings are on, the
#'   splitting set is selected as a bootstrap sample of observations and the
#'   averaging set is selected as a bootstrap sample of the observations which
#'   were left out of bag during the splitting set selection. This leaves a third
#'   set which is the observations which were not selected in either bootstrap sample.
#'   This predict flag gives the predictions using- for each observation- only the trees
#'   in which the observation fell into this third set (so was neither a splitting
#'   nor averaging example).
#'   `coefs` is an aggregation option which works only when linear aggregation
#'   functions have been used. This returns the linear coefficients for each
#'   linear feature which were used in the leaf node regression of each predicted
#'   point.
#' @param holdOutIdx This is an optional argument, containing a vector of indices
#'   from the training data set that should be not be allowed to influence the
#'   predictions of the forest. When a vector of indices of training observations are
#'   given, the predictions will be made only with trees in the forest that
#'   do not contain any of these indices in either the splitting or averaging sets.
#'   This cannot be used at the same time as any other aggregation options.
#'   If `weightMatrix = TRUE`, this will return the
#'   weightMatrix corresponding to the predictions made with trees respecting
#'   holdOutIdx. If there are no trees that have held out all of the indices
#'   in holdOutIdx, then the predictions will return NaN.
#' @param trainingIdx This is an optional parameter to give the indices of the observations
#'   in `newdata` from the training data set. This is used when we want to run predict on
#'   only a subset of observations from the training data set and use `aggregation = "oob"` or
#'   `aggregation = "doubleOOB"`. For example, at the tree level, a tree make out of
#'   bag (`aggregation = "oob"`) predictions for the indices in the set
#'   setdiff(trainingIdx,tree$averagingIndices) and will make double out-of-bag
#'   predictions for the indices in the set
#'   setdiff(trainingIdx,union(tree$averagingIndices,tree$splittingIndices).
#'   Note, this parameter must be set when predict is called with an out-of-bag
#'   aggregation option on a data set not matching the original training data size.
#'   The order of indices in `trainingIdx` also needs to match the order of observations
#'   in newdata. So for an arbitrary index set `trainingIdx` and dataframe `newdata`,
#'    of the same size as the training set, the predictions from `predict(rf, newdata[trainingIdx,],`
#'   `aggregation = "oob", trainingIdx = trainingIdx)` should match the
#'   predictions of to `predict(rf, newdata, aggregation = "oob")[trainingIdx]`.
#'   This option also works with the `weightMatrix` option and will return the
#'   (smaller) weightMatrix for the observations in the passed data frame.
#' @param seed random seed
#' @param nthread The number of threads with which to run the predictions with.
#'   This will default to the number of threads with which the forest was trained
#'   with.
#' @param exact This specifies whether the forest predictions should be aggregated
#'   in a reproducible ordering. Due to the non-associativity of floating point
#'   addition, when we predict in parallel, predictions will be aggregated in
#'   varied orders as different threads finish at different times.
#'   By default, exact is TRUE unless N > 100,000 or a custom aggregation
#'   function is used.
#' @param trees A vector (1-indexed) of indices in the range 1:ntree which tells
#'   predict which trees in the forest to use for the prediction. Predict will by
#'   default take the average of all trees in the forest, although this flag
#'   can be used to get single tree predictions, or averages of diffferent trees
#'   with different weightings. Duplicate entries are allowed, so if trees = c(1,2,2)
#'   this will predict the weighted average prediction of only trees 1 and 2 weighted by:
#'   predict(..., trees = c(1,2,2)) = (predict(..., trees = c(1)) +
#'                                      2*predict(..., trees = c(2))) / 3.
#'   note we must have exact = TRUE, and aggregation = "average" to use tree indices.
#' @param weightMatrix An indicator of whether or not we should also return a
#'   matrix of the weights given to each training observation when making each
#'   prediction. When getting the weight matrix, aggregation must be one of
#'   `average`, `oob`, and `doubleOOB`.
#' @param ... additional arguments.
#' @return A vector of predicted responses.
#' @export
